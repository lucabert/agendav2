RELEASE DATE

INSTALL

1. To install this plugin, copy all files into /plugin/agendav2 folder and
   add it to the plugin array in config/config.inc.php:

   // List of active plugins (in plugins/ directory)
   $rcmail_config['plugins'] = array('agendav2');

2. Download AgenDAV from https://github.com/agendav/agendav/releases/download/2.2.1/ and
   extract it into /plugin/agendav folder:

   The resulting folder structure should look like this:
   /your/path/to/roundcube/plugins/agendav2/agendav-2.2.1

   Example (Linux):

   cd /your/path/to/roundcube/plugins/agendav2
   wget https://github.com/agendav/agendav/releases/download/2.2.1/agendav-2.2.1.tar.gz -O-|tar xzf -

3. Copy agendav.settings.php into /your/path/to/roundcube/plugins/agendav2/agendav-2.2.1/web/config/settings.php
   Change the connection settings for the database and the value for csrf.secret.



CONFIGURATION

1. Copy 'config.inc.php.dist' to 'config.inc.php'.
   Edit the plugin configuration file 'config.inc.php' and set agendav_path and
   agendav_enable_SSO.

   // name of agendav root folder
   $config['agendav_path'] = 'agendav-2.2.1';
   
   // enable SSO
   // * it only works when RoundCube and AgenDAV use the same authentication
   //   backend, because this plugin uses your RoundCube credentials to 
   //   authenticate to AgenDAV
   // * if enabled, roundcube calendar options menu will be disabled
   // * if disabled, you will have to manually enter caldav url, username and
   //   password in Roundcube Calendar settings
   $config['agendav_enable_SSO'] = false;

2. Configure AgenDAV according to the documentation:
   http://docs.agendav.org/en/2.2.1/admin/installation/
   No special config is needed to allow AgenDAV work with this plugin.
   Please note that if you have enabled SSO as explained above, you must set
   caldav baseurl and any other connection settings (f.e. server certificate
   verification) into /your/path/to/roundcube/plugins/agendav2/agendav-2.2.1/web/config/settings.php

3. Create and populate the database for AgenDAV.



KNOWN LIMITATIONS

This is just a simple iframe integration and most likely won't run with newer
development snapshots of AgenDAV.

The RoundCube language setting is not recognized by AgenDAV, because that is
not a user setting in AgenDAV.



NOTE

Tested with AgenDAV 2.2.1
Tested with RoundCube 1.4-git
